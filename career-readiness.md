LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:
Hello, and thanks for stopping by! My name is Anthony S. Holt, Jr, a Full-stack Developer whose passion for technology started from a desire to know how devices (such as MIDI- Musical Instrument Digital Interface) communicate or talk to computers. My interest in audio engineering along with that question led me to pursue a career in IT in the United States Army. After serving 10 years, I started my journey in the civilian sector, determined and focused on the goal to become a Desktop Engineer or a Senior System Administrator. After being introduced to the world of programming, I realized that this career goal was also attainable and more enticing, so I decided to enlist my years of experience, my resilience, discipline, ability to problem solve and adapt to different situations, to becoming a developer that can help create solutions in an inventive yet creative fashion.
